# vue-typescript-class-component-jest
A minimal working version for running vuejs with typescript and class components that compile correctly to .js when writing tests using jest.

The components are written in TypeScript; the tests are written in JavaScript.

Inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/blocka/strange-jest-behavior)
