# vue-typescript-class-component-jest
A minimal working version for running vuejs with typescript and class components that also work correctly when writing tests using jest.

The actual tests are written in JavaScript (I might change my mind and switch them to .ts)

Inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/blocka/strange-jest-behavior)
