# vue-typescript-class-component-jest
A minimal working version for running vuejs with typescript and class components that also work correctly when writing tests using jest.

While the components are written in TypeScript the tests are written in JavaScript; I did not feel that the tests needed that extra layer. (I might change my mind and switch them to .ts) Please feel free to fork a version with test written in typescript.
